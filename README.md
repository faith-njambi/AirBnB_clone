# 0x00.AirBnB clone - The console

## Concept Page
First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

 The goal of AirBnB project is to eventually deploy our server a simple copy of the AirBnB Website(HBnB). A command interpreter is created in this segment to manage objects for the AirBnB(HBnB) website.

## Environment

This project is interpreted/tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.10.12)

## Installation

- Clone this repository
- Access AirBnb directory: cd AirBnB_clone
- Run hbnb(interactively): ./console and enter command
- Run hbnb(non-interactively): echo "<command>" | ./console.py

## Description

This team project is part of alx Software Engineer program. It's the first step towards building a first full web application: an AirBnB clone.
This first step consists of a custom command-line interface for data management,and the base classes for the storage of this data.

## Tests

All the code is tested with the unittest module. The test for the classes are inthe`test_models folder`.

### Functionalities of this command interpreter:
- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
